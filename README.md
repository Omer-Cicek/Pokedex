# Pokedex

![Design preview for the Pokedex Api Project](PokedexGif.gif)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks to visit my Github! In this project, i used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project created with flexbox. I used "Pokedex API". To get data from api, i used fecth method with async-await. For search bar, i checked all poke names if matches or not. Here is the link for this project. (https://omer-cicek.github.io/Pokedex/)

**To do this project, i used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.I used async-await to fetch data.**

## The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Search the Pokemon's data from Pokedex Api
